# xVaultFi

## 🚀 Introducing xVaultFi

[xVaultFi](https://vault.xvaultfi.app/) is a Solana-native protocol designed to unlock the full potential of **real-world assets (RWAs)** in DeFi.
While RWA adoption is accelerating globally, the infrastructure is still heavily **Ethereum-centric** leaving Solana users with RWA tokens they cannot effectively use.

xVaultFi bridges this gap by enabling users to **borrow, earn, and manage liquidity using tokenized RWAs** such as tokenized stocks, gold, and real estate all through a unified, secure lending layer.
Our mission is to make RWAs **useful, composable, and financially productive** on Solana.

> **Vision**\
> xVaultFi’s vision is to make real-world assets truly usable on-chain. While RWA adoption grows rapidly, most activity remains locked on Ethereum and even on Solana, tokenized assets like stocks and gold are primarily used for trading, not finance. We aim to turn RWAs into productive capital by enabling borrowing, lending, and liquidity aggregation powered by real economic value. Our long-term goal is to become the RWA liquidity foundation of Solana, connecting issuers, DeFi protocols, and users to build a seamless on-chain capital market where real assets, liquidity, and user ownership converge.

## Key Features

- **RWA-Backed Borrowing** - Use tokenized stocks (e.g., **TSLAx, AAPLx**) and other RWAs as collateral to borrow **USDC/USDT**.
- **Unified RWA Lending Aggregator** - Compare and access lending markets across Solana DeFi protocols (Kamino, Jupiter, Drift, and more) in one place.
- **SOCL Risk Engine** - A smart liquidation mechanism that **protects against sudden liquidations** by gradually selling collateral and preserving user equity.
- **Native Liquidity Vaults** - Provide liquidity to earn yield from interest, liquidation spreads, and protocol rewards.
- **Future RWA Expansion** - Support planned for tokenized **gold, real estate, fixed-income assets,** and other institutional-grade RWAs.
